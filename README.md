# ***bufferNote***
  
  bufferNote is a fast and minimal note taking app meant for quick notes, testing some writing, or just displaying text ! <br>Simply open up the app, jot down what you need, and when you are done, close the app. 
  <br>bufferNote is not saving your notes, since it is meant to be a quick way to make disposable notes instead of persistent ones. 
  <br>
  
  
  ## How To Use 
  
  Using bufferNote is pretty simple, and it **doesn't even need an internet connection** ! It also works on PC and mobile.
  
  Here's how you can setup bufferNote in X simple steps : 
  
  1. Go to [this link](https://github.com/EosisWasTaken/bufferNote/blob/main/bufferNote.html), and copy the entire code of the app
  2. Open a new tab, and paste the code. You are in the app !
  3. In your navigator of choice, add a bookmark to this page.
  
  Now you can spin up a fresh bufferNote everytime you click on the bookmark (or paste the URI) !

  <summary>ðŸ“– Quick history</summary>
  I recently discovered `data:text/html` URIs, and decided to experiment a bit with them, and It reminded me of and old project I had. <br>I am a huge note taker, but 90% of the things I note don't need to be kept for long, they just need to be noted for a small amount of time before I use it and don't need it anymore. <br>I was doing that with post-its, but it got messy after a moment. So I had the idea of a ultra basic, light and minimal note-taking app that would not allow to save, like what I did with post-its. <br>Here I am now ! A year after I had the idea, the project is done :thumbsup:
